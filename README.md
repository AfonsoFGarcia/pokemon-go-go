# Pokemon Go Go

## Run Linux:

```
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Run Win:

```
gradlew bootRun
```

The first time it runs it will take a while to build as it needs to retrieve node js and bower dependencies.

## Problems

### Got a unexpected http code : 502

Refresh! I mean F5, F5, F5!
